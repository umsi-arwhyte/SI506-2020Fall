# O'Reilly Learning Platform Account Signup

O'Reilly Media, Inc. is a major tech publisher that provides an online learning platform. The Michigan Library has an agreement with O'Reilly that allows you to access O'Reilly's extensive catalogue of books and videos hosted on their platform without a paid subscription (i.e., free access).

You will need to register for an O'Reilly learning platform "school" account to access a number of the SI 506 assigned readings.

:warning: Do __not__ sign up at https://www.oreilly.com/member/. If you visit this page and click "sign in with google" using your `<uniqname>@umich.edu` email address, you will start a free 10-day trial and your email address is tagged by O'Reilly in a way that prevents you from activating your account as a UMich student. If you make this mistake please O'Reilly Customer Service directly at `support@oreilly.com` or by phone at 707-827-7019 or 800-889-8969 and explain your situation. Customer Service will move your "trapped" member account to the UMich school account.
